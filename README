THANKS

Romain Dolbeau for testing the first generation code on a variety of platforms
including: Supermicro mainboard with dual HD 5870s; nVidia Tesla Fermi C2050;
PS3 with STI Cell. Romain gave very valuable feedback at an early stage of
development that contributed to the second generation technology roadmap.

Michael Chu and AMD/ATI for a box of engineering samples. This has been very
helpful to ensure good support across a wide range of GPU cards. It also gave
insight into kernel designs that generalize well across different GPU models.
